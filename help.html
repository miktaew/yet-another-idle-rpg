        As of current game version, the final combat areas are the 'Gentle mountain slope', 'Gang hideout' and 'Writhing tunnel', with that last position expected to be a serious challenge. It is not yet possible to enter the town nor to open the second gate.

    <div class="content">
        Start by opening the browser console and checking if there's any error/warning in it, then lemme know on discord. Make sure to open the console and check if there's anything. If so, copy or screenshot it.<br>
        Seriously, I beg you. It should be a common sense, but majority of people seem to expect devs to just guess what went wrong and fix it without any information.<br>
        Of course I'm also gonna need a description of the issue, sending just the error message won't be of much use.<br>
        
        <br><br>
        Aside from mentioned thread on Arcanum's server, there's also a post on r/incremental_games discord server (game-posts channel), but I check it rarely, so you 100% should tag me (and pray the notification doesn't bug out like they tend to do)

                    <li> 
                        Items: mostly mundane things, such as consumables and materials for further crafting

                    <li>
                        Components: things that can be assembled into equipment of all kinds.<br>
                        Their quality doesn't directly translate to equipment stats and so their own statistics are displayed as "base value", as in value that they would contribute to a 100% quality piece of equipment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Equipment: the actual stuff that you can put on. Mostly created from components, with the exception of 'clothing' which functions more like wearable components<br>
                        Quality is based on skill level, quality of components (for non-clothing equipment) and either tier of components (for non-clothing) or tier of resulting clothing item
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You can obtain resources from passive activities in locations and/or as a loot from combat; items that can be used for crafting will often (but not always) mention it in their descriptions<br>
                For passive gathering activities, things such as time needed, success chance, and number of gained items, are all affected by skill level.

                        Quality of equipment is capped at 100% + 2.8% per skill level.<br>
                        Quality of components (excluding clothing, which falls under equipment) is capped at 100% + 2% per skill level.<br>
                        It exists mainly to make higher tier materials catch up with lower tier ones at some point.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        XP gains from item recipes start going down once you are a few levels over the value needed to max out the success chance, from there they steadily go down to 1.
                        XP gains from component/equipment recipes start going down once relevant skill is more than 8*item_tier, this value is however also multiplied by sqrt of item's rarity multiplier (e.g. sqrt(1.1) for 'uncommon'). They go down to 0.5*material_count for components and down to 1 for equipments.

                        It can't reduce damage taken to less than 1 or 10% of original value, whichever is larger. However, if less than that gets through the shield, that value will be used instead, allowing for very small dmg values and/or full negation.</li>
